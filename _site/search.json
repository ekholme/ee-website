      "contents": "\r\nI am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently an Education Data Specialist for Chesterfield County Public Schools, where I use data to help guide decisions and improve students’ educational experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/analysis, going to the gym, and spending time with friends & family (including my pup, Nala).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI earned my PhD in educational psychology from the VCU School of Education in July 2019, where I worked in the Motivation and Self-Regulation Lab and in the Cognition and Learning Lab to study students’ motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my dissertation, I studied how writers’ daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.\r\nDuring grad school, I discovered a love for working with data – exploring, visualizing, modeling, and communicating. I mostly work (and blog) in R, but I’m always learning new languages and technologies. Well, as much as I can with a toddler and an infant in the house.\r\nProjects and Publications\r\nIf you’re interested in seeing some of the things I’ve worked on, check out my publications page, my visualizations page, or my blog. You can also browse through my Github for things I’m working on that maybe haven’t made it to my website yet.\r\nConsulting and Contracted Work\r\nTime permitting, I occasionally do some consulting and contract work. Although I specialize in educational research, I’m generally proficient with a wide range of statistical modeling frameworks, data visualization, and dashboard design (via {shiny}), among other things. If you’re interested in working with me, send me an email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
