      "contents": "\r\nI am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently an Education Data Specialist for Chesterfield County Public Schools, where I use data to help guide decisions and improve students’ educational experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/analysis, going to the gym, and spending time with friends & family (including my pup, Nala).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI earned my PhD in educational psychology from the VCU School of Education in July 2019, where I worked in the Motivation and Self-Regulation Lab and in the Cognition and Learning Lab to study students’ motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my dissertation, I studied how writers’ daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.\r\nDuring grad school, I discovered a love for working with data – exploring, visualizing, modeling, and communicating. I mostly work in R, and am proficient in the usual packages that folks use for data analysis, visualization, and modeling (e.g. the {tidyverse} and {tidymodels} suites), plus some more specialized packages. I really enjoy discovering new R packages and learning new things that R can do. I’m (very slowly) learning to code in python – there’s not much free time with an infant in the house – and hope to find time to pick up other languages as well.\r\nBlog posts from this website are also contributed to R-bloggers, which you should definitely check out if you haven’t already.\r\nResume\r\nProfessional Experience\r\nEducation Data SpecialistChesterfield County Public Schools (January 2020 - present) \r\nAssociate Director of Early Childhood Data and Analytics Virginia Department of Education  (April 2019 - December 2020) \r\nAffiliate Research Faculty VCU School of Education  (July 2019 - present) \r\nGraduate Research Assistant VCU School of Education  (August 2016 - April 2019) \r\nEnglish Language Arts Teacher Chesterfield County Public Schools  (November 2012 - June 2016) \r\nEducation\r\nPhD in Educational Psychology (2019) Virginia Commonwealth University \r\nAdvisor: Sharon Zumbrunn\r\nDissertation: Investigating Daily Writing Emotions, Attention Regulation, and Productivity: An Intensive Longitudinal Study \r\nMT in English Education (2012) Virginia Commonwealth University \r\nBA in English (2010) Virginia Tech \r\nTechnical Skills & Tools\r\nProgramming: R, Python, SQL\r\nStatistics/Modeling: R, Mplus, Blimp, Stata, Excel, SPSS\r\nProficient in several modeling approaches/frameworks, including inferential modeling, predictive modeling, unsupervised learning, meta-analysis, text mining/analysis, and more. \r\n\r\nVisualization: R, Inkscape\r\nPublications\r\nSee my list of publications on my publications page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
